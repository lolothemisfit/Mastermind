This is a C++ project called mastermind. It is basically a game in which you are given a 4 digit pin that is randomly generated.
You are given 10 chances to crack the pin.
Given clues once user input is compared to the randomly generated pin such as:
 how many digits are correct but not in the correct place;
 how many digits are in the correct place;
 how many incorrect digits.
 
 Pin is randomly generated each time you end the program and run it again.
